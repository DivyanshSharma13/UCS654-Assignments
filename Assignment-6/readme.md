# Student Score Prediction Assignment

## Methodology
1. **Simulation Topic:** Predicting Exam Scores based on Study Hours and Sleep.
2. **Steps:**
   - I used Python to generate random data for 1000 students.
   - Formula used: `Score = 10*Study + 5*Sleep + Random_Noise`.
   - I tested 2 Machine Learning models to see which one predicts better.

## Results Table
| Model Name | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 98% (approx) |
| Decision Tree | 95% (approx) |

## Conclusion
Linear Regression worked best because the relationship between study hours and marks is simple and linear.
